= Ruby D-Bus README

Ruby D-Bus provides an implementation of the D-Bus protocol such that the
D-Bus system can be used in the Ruby programming language.

== Requirements

 * Ruby 1.8 (>= 1.8.6?)

== Installation

 1. Decompress the Ruby D-Bus tarball (ruby-dbus-<version>.tar.gz).
 2. Move to top-level directory and type:

      $ ruby setup.rb config
      $ ruby setup.rb setup
     ($ su)
      # ruby setup.rb install

    You can also install files in your favorite directory by
    supplying setup.rb some options. Try "ruby setup.rb --help".

== Usage

 See some of the examples in the examples/ subdirectory of the tarball.
